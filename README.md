Hello!  Welcome to RestaurantPOS!
Using this program, you will be able to take someone's order just like you were working at a restaurant.
Once you run the program, you will be met with a screen that shows all of the menu items on the left side with their prices.
Choose a table to start taking the order using the dropdown box up top.
Click which menu items you would like to add to your order and these items will add themselves to the right side of your screen to indicate your selections.
The total price of your order will automatically be added up at the bottom of your screen.
If you make a mistake and accidentally order something, simply click the item and hit the remove item button.
You can also clear the entire order by hitting the clear order button.
You are able to jump between tables and add to/delete from the orders as you please.
Happy ordering!
